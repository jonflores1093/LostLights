    "facts9":"A lunar eclipse happens when the Earth is between the Sun and the moon causing the Earth to cast a shadow onto the moon.",
    "facts10":"The area that completely covers the moon is called the Umbra. When the moon turns a reddish color,  it is in the Umbra.",
    "facts11":"The area that Earth doesn't cover the moon fully is called the Penumbra. When the moon isn't red in color, it is in the Penumbra.",
    "facts12":"Total Lunar Eclipses are less common. The last total lunar eclipse was on Nov. 8th 2022.  The next one to happen will be March 14th, 2025!",
    "facts13":"The Earth will experience two lunar eclipses in 2023, one of which will be a penumbral lunar eclipse on May 5th across parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia.",

    "facts17":"Penumbral Lunar Eclipse is when the faint outer part of the Earth's shadow is cast across the lunar surface.",
    "facts18":"A Solar Eclipse happens when the moon is in between the Sun and Earth. This causes the moon to cast a shadow onto the Earth.",
    "facts19":"Solar Eclipses only occur when all three (Sun, Moon and Earth) are lined up and in the same plane.",

    "facts24":"Annular Solar Eclipse is when the moon is centered in front of the Sun but does not fully cover the sun's disk.",

    "tutorialButton7":"Congrats! You finished the tutorial! It's difficult to see, but the Earth here is on a tilt. The Earth being on a tilt causes different seasons to occur when the Earth faces the Sun at various positions! Remember, approximately every 3 months a new season occurs! Click me to progress to the stage select!",

    "lunarButton3":"Hopefully you remembered what each eclipse looked like! If you get stuck don't worry, after 3 tries a hint will appear. Click me to continue!",
    "lunarButton4":"Good Job! Next level will really challenge your memory so get ready! Click me to progress!",
    "lunarButton5":"No images this time! Hopefully you memorized the name of each eclipse. Otherwise you'll have a tough time. Good Luck! Click me to continue!",

    "solarButton3":"The last level you learned about an Annular Eclipse. Here you will learn about Partial Eclipse. Take note of the differences in position of the Moon between the Earth and Sun! Click me to continue!",
    "solarButton4":"Great Job! If you had noticed, the position of the Moon is slightly different from the previous level which causes the shadow casted to be shifted down! Click me to progress!",
    "solarButton5":"Last level, you got this! Total eclipses occur every 18 months so you might not be able to see one anytime soon, but you will get to know what they look like! Click me to continue!",
