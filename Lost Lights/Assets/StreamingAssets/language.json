    "facts23" : "Partial solar eclipse is when the moon doesn't completely cover the sun.",
    "facts24" : "Annular solar eclipse is when the moon is centered in front of the Sun but does not fully cover the Sun's disk.",
    "facts25" : "When the Sun is bigger than the moon it is an annular solar eclipse. When the moon and sun look like the same size, it is a total solar eclipse."
